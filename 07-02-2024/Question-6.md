Rotating an Array - Unraveling the Rotation Mystery

Introduction:
In the realm of Data Structures and Algorithms, a common challenge often surfaces: rotating an array. Today, we'll delve into a fascinating problem that asks us to rotate an integer array to the right by a specified number of steps. This challenge not only tests our algorithmic prowess but also encourages us to explore various strategies to efficiently solve it.

**Problem Statement:**
Given an integer array `nums` and a non-negative integer `k`, we are tasked with rotating the array to the right by `k` steps.

**Example 1:**
Input: `nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]`, `k = 3`
Output: `[5,6,7,1,2,3,4]`

**Example 2:**
Input: `nums = [-1,-100,3,99]`, `k = 2`
Output: `[3,99,-1,-100]`

**Constraints:**
- 1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
- -2^31 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1
- 0 <= k <= 10^5

**Brute Force Approach:**
One straightforward approach to solving this problem is to perform the rotation step-by-step. For each rotation, we can shift all elements one position to the right. This process is repeated `k` times.

```cpp
void rotate(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    int n = nums.size();
    for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
        int last = nums[n - 1];
        for (int j = n - 1; j > 0; --j) {
            nums[j] = nums[j - 1];
        }
        nums[0] = last;
    }
}
```

While this brute-force approach is simple, it has a time complexity of O(k * n), which may become inefficient for large values of `k`.

**Better Solution:**
A more optimized approach involves using extra space to store the rotated array. We can copy the last `k` elements to a temporary array, shift the remaining elements to the right, and then copy back the temporary array to the beginning.

```cpp
void rotate(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    int n = nums.size();
    k %= n;
    
    vector<int> temp(k);
    for (int i = n - k; i < n; ++i) {
        temp[i - (n - k)] = nums[i];
    }
    
    for (int i = n - 1; i >= k; --i) {
        nums[i] = nums[i - k];
    }
    
    for (int i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
        nums[i] = temp[i];
    }
}
```

**Optimal Solution:**
An optimal solution with O(n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity involves a clever reversal approach. We can reverse the entire array, then reverse the first `k` elements, and finally reverse the remaining `n-k` elements.

```cpp
void rotate(vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    int n = nums.size();
    k %= n;
    
    reverse(nums.begin(), nums.end());
    reverse(nums.begin(), nums.begin() + k);
    reverse(nums.begin() + k, nums.end());
}
```

This optimal solution provides an efficient and concise way to solve the rotation problem.

**Conclusion:**
Rotating an array is a captivating challenge that allows us to explore various strategies. From the brute force approach to a more efficient space-optimized solution, and finally, the optimal reversal method â€“ understanding these different techniques equips us with a versatile set of skills in the realm of data structures and algorithms.
