# Two Sets Problem

**Problem Statement:** You are given a positive integer \( n \). Your task is to divide the numbers \( 1, 2, ..., n \) into two sets of equal sum.

## Input
The input consists of a single integer n ( 1 <= n <= 10^3 ).

## Output
If such a division is possible, output "YES", followed by two lines. The first line should contain \( m \), the number of elements in the first set, followed by the elements themselves. The second line should contain \( n - m \), the number of elements in the second set, followed by the elements themselves.

If multiple solutions exist, you may print any of them. If no solution is possible, output "NO".

## Examples

**Input:**
```
7
```

**Output:**
```
YES
4
1 2 4 7
3
3 5 6
```

**Input:**
```
5
```

**Output:**
```
NO
```

## Approaches

### 1. Mathematical Approach

**Algorithm / Intuition:**
1. Calculate the total sum of numbers from \(1\) to \(n\), denoted as \(total\).
2. If \(total\) is odd, it's impossible to divide the numbers into two sets of equal sum, so output "NO".
3. Otherwise, if no is even divide the numbers into two sets by putting pairs of first and last numbers alternatively on both sets, if no is odd, put the last or first number on one of the set and do the same as you've done in even approach 

EX- For even ex lets consider 8
- [1 8 3 6]
- [2 7 4 5]

For odd ex lets consider 7, we will put number 7 on set 2
- [1 6 3 4]
- [7 2 6]

logic behind this is that pairs (i, n-i+1) are all same

**Approach:**
1. Calculate \(total\) using (n x (n+1))/2 formula.
2. If \(total\) is odd, output "NO".
3. Otherwise, output "YES" followed by printing two sets with above logic

#### Code

```cpp
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int N;

int main() {
    cin >> N;
    if (N % 4 == 1 || N % 4 == 2)
        cout << "NO" << endl;
    else if (N % 4 == 3) {
        cout << "YES" << endl;
        cout << N / 2 << endl;
        for (int i = 2; i <= N / 2; i += 2)
            cout << i << " " << N - i << " ";
        cout << N << endl << N / 2 + 1 << endl;
        for (int i = 1; i <= N / 2; i += 2)
            cout << i << " " << N - i << " ";
    } else {
        cout << "YES" << endl;
        cout << N / 2 << endl;
        for (int i = 2; i <= N / 2; i += 2)
            cout << i << " " << N - i + 1 << " ";
        cout << endl << N / 2 << endl;
        for (int i = 1; i <= N / 2; i += 2)
            cout << i << " " << N - i + 1 << " ";
    }
    return 0;
}

```

**Complexity Analysis:**
- Time complexity: \(O(n)\)
- Space complexity: \(O(1)\)
