## Leaders in an Array

### Problem Statement:
Given an array of integers, find and print all the elements that are leaders. A leader is an element that is greater than all the elements to its right in the array.

### Example:
```
Input: [16, 17, 4, 3, 5, 2]
Output: Leaders are 17, 5, and 2.
```

### Explanation:
In the given example, 17 is greater than all the elements to its right (4, 3, 5, 2). Similarly, 5 is greater than 2 which is to its right.

## Brute Force Approach:

### Explanation:
A brute force approach for this problem involves iterating through each element of the array and checking if it is greater than all the elements to its right. If it is, then it is a leader.

### Implementation:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

void findLeadersBruteForce(const vector<int>& arr) {
    int n = arr.size();

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        bool isLeader = true;
        for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
            if (arr[i] <= arr[j]) {
                isLeader = false;
                break;
            }
        }
        if (isLeader) {
            cout << arr[i] << " ";
        }
    }
    cout << "\n";
}

int main() {
    vector<int> arr = {16, 17, 4, 3, 5, 2};
    cout << "Leaders (Brute Force): ";
    findLeadersBruteForce(arr);

    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of the brute force approach is O(n^2) since, for each element, we check against all elements to its right.

### Optimal Approach:

### Explanation:
The optimal approach involves traversing the array from right to left and maintaining a variable (`maxRight`) to keep track of the maximum element encountered so far from the right. If an element is greater than or equal to `maxRight`, it is a leader. We update `maxRight` accordingly.

### Implementation:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

void findLeadersOptimal(const vector<int>& arr) {
    int n = arr.size();
    int maxRight = arr[n - 1];

    cout << "Leaders (Optimal): " << maxRight << " ";

    for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
        if (arr[i] > maxRight) {
            cout << arr[i] << " ";
            maxRight = arr[i];
        }
    }
    cout << "\n";
}

int main() {
    vector<int> arr = {16, 17, 4, 3, 5, 2};
    findLeadersOptimal(arr);

    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of the optimal approach is O(n) since we traverse the array only once.

### Conclusion:
The brute force approach involves nested loops and checks every element against all elements to its right. This leads to a higher time complexity. The optimal approach, on the other hand, optimizes the solution by traversing the array only once from right to left, identifying leaders in a more efficient manner. The optimal approach is preferred, especially for large arrays, due to its lower time complexity.
