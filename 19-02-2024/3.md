## Problem Explanation

The "Count Subarray Sum Equals K" problem asks us to find the total number of subarrays within an array where the sum of elements equals a given target value, `k`. A subarray is defined as a contiguous, non-empty sequence of elements within the array.

For example, consider the array `nums = [1, 1, 1]` and `k = 2`. The subarrays with a sum equal to 2 are `[1, 1]` and `[2]`. Therefore, the expected result is 2.

## Brute Force Approach

A straightforward approach to solving this problem is to consider all possible subarrays and check if the sum of each subarray is equal to the target `k`. We can use two nested loops to iterate over all possible start and end indices of subarrays. For each subarray, we calculate the sum and increment a counter if the sum equals `k`.

### Brute Force Algorithm

1. Initialize a counter variable to keep track of the number of subarrays with sum equal to `k`.
2. Use two nested loops to iterate over all possible start and end indices of subarrays.
3. For each subarray, calculate the sum of its elements.
4. If the sum is equal to `k`, increment the counter.
5. After both loops, the counter contains the total number of subarrays with sum equal to `k`.

### Brute Force Code

```cpp
#include <vector>

int countSubarraysBruteForce(std::vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    int count = 0;
    int n = nums.size();

    // Iterate over all possible subarrays
    for (int start = 0; start < n; ++start) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int end = start; end < n; ++end) {
            // Calculate the sum of the current subarray
            sum += nums[end];

            // If the sum is equal to k, increment the counter
            if (sum == k) {
                count++;
            }
        }
    }

    return count;
}
```

### Time Complexity
The brute force approach has a time complexity of O(n^3), where n is the length of the input array. This is because we have two nested loops to iterate over all possible subarrays, and for each subarray, we calculate the sum, resulting in a cubic time complexity.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is O(1) since we use a constant amount of space, irrespective of the input size.

## Optimal Approach

The optimal approach for this problem involves using a cumulative sum (prefix sum) and a hash map. By keeping track of the cumulative sum at each index, we can efficiently check the number of subarrays with a sum equal to `k`.

### Optimal Algorithm

1. Initialize a hash map to store the cumulative sum frequencies.
2. Initialize variables for the cumulative sum, the counter of subarrays, and set an initial cumulative sum value of 0.
3. Iterate through the array, updating the cumulative sum at each index.
4. Check if the difference between the current cumulative sum and the target `k` exists in the hash map. If it does, increment the counter by the corresponding frequency.
5. Update the hash map with the current cumulative sum frequency.
6. After iterating through the array, the counter contains the total number of subarrays with sum equal to `k`.

### Optimal Code

```cpp
#include <vector>
#include <unordered_map>

int countSubarraysOptimal(std::vector<int>& nums, int k) {
    std::unordered_map<int, int> prefixSumFreq;
    int count = 0;
    int cumulativeSum = 0;

    // Initialize the map with a prefix sum of 0
    prefixSumFreq[0] = 1;

    for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
        // Update cumulative sum
        cumulativeSum += nums[i];

        // Check if the difference (cumulativeSum - k) exists in the map
        if (prefixSumFreq.find(cumulativeSum - k) != prefixSumFreq.end()) {
            // Increment the counter by the frequency of the difference
            count += prefixSumFreq[cumulativeSum - k];
        }

        // Update the map with the current cumulative sum frequency
        prefixSumFreq[cumulativeSum]++;
    }

    return count;
}
```

### Time Complexity
The optimal approach has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input array. This is because we iterate through the array once, and for each element, we perform constant-time operations.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the input array. This is because we use a hash map to store cumulative sum frequencies, and in the worst case, it can have n entries.
